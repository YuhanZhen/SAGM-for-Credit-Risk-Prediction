# SAGNN-for-Credit-Risk-Prediction

## Paper data and code

This is the code for the PAKDD 2022 Paper. [SAGNN: Self-attention Graph Neural Networkwith Multi-task Learning for Credit RiskPrediction](). We have implemented our methods in **Pytorch**.

Here are two datasets we used in our paper. After downloaded the datasets, you can put them in the folder `data/sample/:`

- [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data)
- [Lending Club](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club?select=accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv.gz)

There is a small dataset `sample` included in the folder `data/`, which can be used to test the correctness of the code.

## Usage

## Requiremetns

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.1.0

All the depedent packages can be found on `requirements.txt`, you can use pip wheel to install these packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt -v`
